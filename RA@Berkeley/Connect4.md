# Connect4
Connect4 is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. It's a zero-sum game, and could be solved by artificial algorithms like minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
