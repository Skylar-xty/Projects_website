# Introduction

This research was funded by Zhuhai UM Science&Technology Research Institute.

I'm currently:
- Focusing on enhancing model training in Surgical robotics through human-in-the-loop methods based on [SurRoL](https://med-air.github.io/SurRoL/).
- Exploring human-robot shared control during testing to achieve seamless integration between AI-learned policies
and human teleoperation for precise control.
- Conducting policy learning algorithm research, particularly on task autonomy in long-horizon, complex tasks such
as game-based suturing and skin manipulation, with an emphasis on PPO skill learning.
- Preparing a research paper for submission to IEEE IROS 2025.
