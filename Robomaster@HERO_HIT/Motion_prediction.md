# Target Tracking and Aiming System in Complex Motion Environment
I was an algorithm designer and tester in my university's robotics team, participating in Robomaster University Championships Competition (organized by Dajiang Innovation), progressing from provincial and regional competitions to the national finals.

## Videos

Here are some videos during testing and real performance.

The Figure shows the UI interface of our robots when the target mobile armor was moving in both X, Y directions with different moving speeds.

This is part of the live streaming of one game in the National Robomaster Finals. And our team is the red side, you can focus on two number-five robots having one-to-one shooting.
