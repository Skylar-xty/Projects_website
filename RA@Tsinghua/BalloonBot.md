# Balloon Robot

- The research was funded by the ACSP program of Global Innovation Exchange, Tsinghua University.
In this research, I
- Proposed and developed the first social balloon robot, integrating movement and sensing capabilities powered
by ESP32S3, based on comprehensive research and user needs analysis in human-robot interaction.
- Proposed downstream applications, with LLM and object detection algorithms, targeting balloon robot
characteristics and relevant literature background.
- Collected and analyzed user feedback through interviews(N=33), applying structured coding to refine functions.
- 
- Led the writing of a research paper that passed the first-round review for CHI â€™25 as the first student author
